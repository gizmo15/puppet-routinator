# Routinator Configuration
#
# The configuration file is a TOML file. It consists of a sequence of
# key-value pairs, each on its own line. Strings are to be enclosed in
# double quotes. Lists of values can be given by enclosing a
# comma-separated sequence of these values in square brackets.
#
# See https://github.com/toml-lang/toml for detailed information on the
# format.
#
# This file contains all configuration settings with explanations and their
# default values.

# Listen addresses for RTR TCP transport.
#
# This is an array of strings, each string a socket address of the form
# "address:port" with IPv6 address in square brackets.

# Listen addresses for Prometheus HTTP monitoring endpoint.
#
# This is an array of strings, each string a socket address of the form
# "address:port" with IPv6 address in square brackets.
#
# Port 9556 is allocated for the routinator exporter.
